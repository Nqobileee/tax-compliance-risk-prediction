## Overview

Corporate tax non-compliance poses a significant threat to Zimbabwe's fiscal sustainability. The Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA) currently relies heavily on **manual audit selection** — resource-intensive, inconsistent, and unable to scale with the growing volume and complexity of corporate tax filings.

**TaxGuard** proposes a hybrid machine learning framework that integrates unsupervised and supervised techniques to:

- Detect anomalies in corporate tax returns
- Assign **probabilistic risk scores** to each filing
- Provide **SHAP-based explainability** for auditor-facing flag justification
- Support **continuous learning** from completed audit outcomes

This repository contains the research prototype: exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and a production-grade hybrid ML pipeline.

## Problem Statement

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Manual audit selection | High-risk filings may evade detection |
| No data-driven prioritisation | Compliant firms face disproportionate scrutiny |
| Subjective heuristics | Inconsistent audit allocation across regions |
| Scale limitations | Cannot keep pace with filing volume growth |

TaxGuard addresses these gaps through intelligent, accountable, data-driven fiscal governance aligned with Zimbabwe's **National AI Strategy (2026–2030)** and **National Development Strategy 2**.

### Key Detection Features

- Income-to-expense ratio deviations (`Profit_Margin`)
- Inter-period tax rate inconsistencies (`Tax_Rate_Deviation`, `ETR_to_STR_Ratio`)
- Offshore / transfer pricing exposure (`Offshore_Intensity`)
- Sector-based outlier patterns (engineered interactions)
- Aggressive tax planning composites (`Planning_Deviation_Interaction`)
- Governance weakness indicators (`Control_Risk`, ownership concentration)

| `Effective_Tax_Rate` | Reported effective rate (%) |
| `Offshore_Transactions_Million` | Offshore transaction value |
| `Ownership_Concentration_Percent` | Ownership concentration index |
| `Internal_Control_Score` | Internal control quality (1–5) |
| `Audit_Likelihood` | Existing ZIMRA heuristic score |
| `Audit_Outcome` | Clean / Qualified / Adverse |
| `History_Fines_Million` | Prior penalty history |
| `Offshore_Subsidiaries` | Count of offshore entities |
| `Aggressive_Tax_Planning_Score` | Planning aggressiveness index |

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/tax-compliance-risk-prediction.git
cd tax-compliance-risk-prediction
python -m venv .venv

# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run exploratory analysis

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/01_taxguard_eda.ipynb
```

### 3. Train the hybrid model

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/02_taxguard_hybrid_model.ipynb
```

Model artefacts are saved to `outputs/models/taxguard_ensemble.pkl`.

## Key Findings (EDA)

1. **`Tax_Rate_Deviation`** is the strongest univariate predictor of high-risk filings (AUC > 0.90).
2. **Composite indicators** (offshore intensity × weak controls, planning × deviation) surface cohorts invisible to single-variable manual rules.
3. ZIMRA's existing **`Audit_Likelihood`** heuristic underperforms top engineered features — validating ML investment.
4. **Risk labels correlate significantly** with audit outcomes — supporting supervised retraining on completed audits.
5. Firms with **clean audit history but high planning scores** remain elevated risk — a pattern manual selection often misses.

---

## Model Performance

Metrics are computed via **5-fold stratified cross-validation** with out-of-fold predictions (no data leakage):

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **ROC-AUC** | High-risk filing discrimination |
| **PR-AUC** | Precision-recall for imbalanced audit costing |
| **Brier Score** | Probability calibration quality |
| **F1 @ optimal threshold** | Operational audit queue sizing |

Run `02_taxguard_hybrid_model.ipynb` for full results. Metrics are exported to `outputs/models/taxguard_metrics.json`.

---

## ZIMRA Deployment Recommendations

1. **Integrate TaxGuard scores** into the Audit Management System (AMS) workflow.
2. **Display SHAP waterfall charts** alongside flagged cases for auditor transparency.
3. **Retrain quarterly** on Adverse and Qualified audit closures (continuous learning loop).
4. **Expand data ingestion** to VAT-to-turnover ratios and sector classification codes.
5. **Calibrate thresholds** by sector and entity size to ensure equitable audit allocation.
